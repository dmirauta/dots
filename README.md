Edit wallpaper paths(s) (`feh` command in `bspwmrc`) and monitor count related lines.

See auto.sh

Notes:
- spectacle is nice but may bring in too many KDE dependencies? (Otherwise KDE system settings is also quite nice)
- many use thunar as part of their minimal setup so xfce4 apps are not a worry? (hence xfce4-power-manager is ok)
    - otherwise ranger and/or broot
